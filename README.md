# Kaggle-Digit-Recognizer
Kaggle submission of the Digit Recognizer challenge using multiple ML Algorithms and their result comparisons.

## Analysis of Different Algorithms

My first submission was using K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm (taking K = 3), which gave an accuracy of 96.857%. The accuracy went up to 96.943% when applying PCA before KNN.

The next submission was made by using PCA with SVM, which gave an accuracy of 98.057%, much better than the previous predictions.

Next prediction was made using decision tree, which brought the accuracy down to 85.286%.
